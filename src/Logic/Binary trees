Binary Trees are:
    Linked, nonlinear data structures
    each node contains data and two or more links
    Left link and right link
    Binary trees only point two ways

Terminologies in Binary trees:
    1.) Node // stores data and references to other nodes
    2.) Root // Topmost node in a tree
    3.) Children are under parents
    4.) Internal nodes: nodes with at least one child
    5.) Leaf node is a node with no child
    6.) Left subtree: a subset of the tree rooted at a node pointed by a
        left link.  Does not include root.
    7.) Right subtree : above but right.
    8.) A subtree is also a binary tree.
